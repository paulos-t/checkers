TODO: spec, UML diagram, then questions about organization of modules/classes and making code general and reusable for other checker-board games like chess; if thereâ€™s time, start looking at specifics on data structures and logic


CheckerBoard
- attribute: board_state

Player


Abstract Base Class: Piece
- attribute: state, can be IN_PLAY or CAPTURED
- simple_move method
    - diagonally forward
- jump method
    - needs to know:
